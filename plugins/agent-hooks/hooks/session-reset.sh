# SessionStart hook — clears stale gate files so a crashed session cannot deadlock
# the next one.
#
# This exists ONLY to serve review-plan-before-exit.sh, which arms a session-scoped
# `.plan-review-gate-<session-id>` file. If a session dies between arming the gate
# and re-presenting its plan, the file is left behind; without this prune, the next
# session in that repo inherits it and is blocked on a review it cannot satisfy.
#
# TRIMMED IN THE PORT from k0d3's 89-line version. Dropped:
#   - chmod +x over $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/hooks
#   - frontmatter validation over $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/agents
#     Both only ever did anything inside the k0d3 repo itself, whose layout put
#     those directories at the project root. They are no-ops in any other repo.
#   - audit-trail.md truncation, which served the log-changes hook that is not
#     being ported.
#   - pruning of .quality-gate-active, .tool-call-count and .compaction-occurred.
#     No surviving hook writes any of them.

# Prune by AGE, never by name. Gate files are session-scoped

# fresh gate — that would force it through a redundant review pass.
#
# Known quirk, carried over unchanged: a session idle for more than two hours
# between presenting a plan and re-presenting it loses its gate and is asked to
# review once more. Annoying, not harmful; the alternative (name-based pruning)
# breaks concurrent sessions, which is worse.
