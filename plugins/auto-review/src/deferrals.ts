/**
 * The index of turns currently parked behind a busy checkout.
 *
 * Per-thread state already records that a turn is deferred, but nothing
 * enumerates threads, so a sweep with no thread in hand could not find them.
 * This index is that enumeration: small (only currently-parked turns), and
 * self-healing — an entry whose thread no longer defers, or no longer exists,
 * is dropped by the sweep that reads it.
 *
 * One key per thread, deliberately: the KV API offers no compare-and-swap, so
 * a single shared array would be a read-modify-write that loses an entry when
 * two threads park at once — and a lost entry is invisible to the sweep, which
 * is the exact stranding the sweep exists to prevent.
